            With my training and background in programming and design, and my extensive use of Javascript, HTML and CSS I feel I am an excellent candidate for this position. I know I would be a valuable asset to any team.

            I worked as a Front End developer in the “early” days of the internet and I was mostly self-taught in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PERL for 12 years. While I have room for growth in learning code exams that some companies require, I’m proficient at laying out a solution and researching the pieces I need to put everything together. I know the methods I need, I sometimes struggle with syntax, but I can find answers quickly. I am actively studying C# and Python and Algorithms. I enjoy C# in that I find it a lot like JavaScript with specifying variable types.

            I did leave the field for several years to pursue opportunities in the dive industry and to run Hammerhead Spearguns manufacturing business. However, upon my return, I enrolled myself in a University of Arizona boot camp which focused on the basics of web development through Node.js and React.js. This training gave me a refresher in the portions I already knew, while exposing me to the modern frameworks such as Bootstrap and React.

            In my most recent position I was hired to work on a front-end team that used HTML, CSS and some vanilla Javascript. Within 4 months, I was moved to another team to help develop single page applications. These positions added Zurb Foundation and Vue.js to my skill set. This position was also my first exposure to C#.
