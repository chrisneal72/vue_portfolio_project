We were out spearfishing looking for big pelagic species of fish, like tuna and ono (wahoo). We shot a few fish, we dropped a lot of bait. Eventually we had some ono come in, but we did not manage to land a shot. Every so often a few sharks would come around. None of the sharks were big, only six to eight feet long. Then, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. A white patch. Is that a dolphin out here!? NOPE! that was just the white around the eye! A Humpback whale came gliding along and turned on its side to get a look at us. He stayed about 30 feet away from us and just checked us out. After it passed, it surfaced, grabbed a breath and kept on keeping on.  That was my story! Thanks for sticking around.<br />",
